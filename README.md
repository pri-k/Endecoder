# Endecoder

<p>The Endecoder project is a simple cipher inspired by the ROT13 algorithm, with an improved functionality to handle special characters and numbers in addition to alphabets. The project consists of a single file named endecoder.py, which contains two functions: enprik() and deprik().</p>

## Functions

### enprik()

The `enprik()` function takes a string as input and applies the Endecoder cipher to it. The cipher algorithm replaces each character in the input string with another character, resulting in an encrypted version of the original input. The encryption process is designed to preserve the special characters, numbers, and alphabets.

#### Example Usage:

```python
encrypted_text = enprik("Hello, World!")
print(encrypted_text)
```
### deprik()

The `deprik()` function is the counterpart of the `enprik()` function. It takes an encrypted string as input and applies the decryption process to retrieve the original plaintext. The decryption process reverses the cipher algorithm and restores the special characters, numbers, and alphabets to their original positions.

#### Example Usage:

```python
decrypted_text = deprik("Hello, World!")
print(decrypted_text)
```
## Usage
Download the endecoder.py file and you can import the functions to your program.
